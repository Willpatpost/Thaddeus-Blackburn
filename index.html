    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hey, my name is Thaddeus Blackburn, and I’m a senior at the University of Wyoming, majoring in Sales with a minor in Leadership. 
      My drive to create value for customers through sales has led me to build skills in client relations, lead generation, and strategic outreach.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve had the opportunity to represent the University of Wyoming on the National Sales Team, where I’ve honed my competitive selling 
      skills and gained invaluable experience in high-stakes sales scenarios. My background also includes co-founding XT Details, where I handled all 
      sales, marketing, and web design, as well as serving as a Sales Development Representative at English from A to Z.
